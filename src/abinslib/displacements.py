"""Functions for calculation of atomic displacement tensors.

The phonon mode displacements are described by 3x3 matrices related to the
covariance matrices of atomic positions associated with each mode. In the
CLIMAX/Abins notation this is 'B' and may include a Bose occupation factor.

The sum over modes (include Brillouin Zone integration for periodic systems)
with appropriate Bose occupation gives a physical distribution known in various
forms as 'A', 'Atomic Displacement Parameters', 'U', ... and sometimes even
'B'.

In abinslib these are referred to respectively as 'mode displacements' and
'atomic displacements' where space permits, or 'B' and 'A' in compact notation,
downcased to 'b' and 'a' in python variable names.

The Quantity A is equal to the debye_waller attribute of the DebyeWaller
class from Euphonic and may be read/stored from that class as convenient.

    displacements:
      Atomic displacement tensor Quantity with dimensions
      (qpts, modes, atoms, 3, 3) and units length^2, without Bose occupation
      factor. (i.e. with the same values as the "one" property on resulting

      Normalised q-point weights corresponding to axis 0 of mode_displacements
    bose_n:
      Bose factors <n> corresponding to displacements at target temperature.
